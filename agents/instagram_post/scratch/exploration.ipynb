Claude 3.5 Sonnet raises the industry bar for\\nintelligence, outperforming competitor models and Claude 3 Opus on a wide\\nrange of evaluations, with the speed and cost of our mid-tier model, Claude 3\\nSonnet.\\n\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet is now available for free on Claude.ai and the Claude iOS\\napp, while Claude Pro and Team plan subscribers can access it with\\nsignificantly higher rate limits. It is also available via the Anthropic API,\\nAmazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. The model costs $3 per million\\ninput tokens and $15 per million output tokens, with a 200K token context\\nwindow.\\n\\n### Frontier intelligence at 2x the speed\\n\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet sets new industry benchmarks for graduate-level reasoning\\n(GPQA), undergraduate-level knowledge (MMLU), and coding proficiency\\n(HumanEval). It shows marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and\\ncomplex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with\\na natural, relatable tone.\\n\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet operates at twice the speed of Claude 3 Opus. This\\nperformance boost, combined with cost-effective pricing, makes Claude 3.5\\nSonnet ideal for complex tasks such as context-sensitive customer support and\\norchestrating multi-step workflows.\\n\\nIn an internal agentic coding evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet solved 64% of\\nproblems, outperforming Claude 3 Opus which solved 38%. Our evaluation tests\\nthe model’s ability to fix a bug or add functionality to an open source\\ncodebase, given a natural language description of the desired improvement.\\nWhen instructed and provided with the relevant tools, Claude 3.5 Sonnet can\\nindependently write, edit, and execute code with sophisticated reasoning and\\ntroubleshooting capabilities. It handles code translations with ease, making\\nit particularly effective for updating legacy applications and migrating\\ncodebases.\\n\\n### State-of-the-art vision\\n\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet is our strongest vision model yet, surpassing Claude 3 Opus\\non standard vision benchmarks. These step-change improvements are most\\nnoticeable for tasks that require visual reasoning, like interpreting charts\\nand graphs. Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also accurately transcribe text from\\nimperfect images—a core capability for retail, logistics, and financial\\nservices, where AI may glean more insights from an image, graphic or\\nillustration than from text alone.\\n\\n### Artifacts—a new way to use Claude\\n\\nToday, we’re also introducing Artifacts on Claude.ai, a new feature that\\nexpands how users can interact with Claude. When a user asks Claude to\\ngenerate content like code snippets, text documents, or website designs, these\\nArtifacts appear in a dedicated window alongside their conversation. This\\ncreates a dynamic workspace where they can see, edit, and build upon Claude’s\\ncreations in real-time, seamlessly integrating AI-generated content into their\\nprojects and workflows.\\n\\nThis preview feature marks Claude’s evolution from a conversational AI to a\\ncollaborative work environment. It’s just the beginning of a broader vision\\nfor Claude.ai, which will soon expand to support team collaboration. In the\\nnear future, teams—and eventually entire organizations—will be able to\\nsecurely centralize their knowledge, documents, and ongoing work in one shared\\nspace, with Claude serving as an on-demand teammate.\\n\\n### Commitment to safety and privacy\\n\\nOur models are subjected to rigorous testing and have been trained to reduce\\nmisuse. Despite Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s leap in intelligence, our red teaming\\nassessments have concluded that Claude 3.5 Sonnet remains at ASL-2. More\\ndetails can be found in the model card addendum.\\n\\nAs part of our commitment to safety and transparency, we’ve engaged with\\nexternal experts to test and refine the safety mechanisms within this latest\\nmodel. We recently provided Claude 3.5 Sonnet to the UK’s Artificial\\nIntelligence Safety Institute (UK AISI) for pre-deployment safety evaluation.\\nThe UK AISI completed tests of 3.5 Sonnet and shared their results with the US\\nAI Safety Institute (US AISI) as part of a Memorandum of Understanding, made\\npossible by the partnership between the US and UK AISIs announced earlier this\\nyear.\\n\\nWe have integrated policy feedback from outside subject matter experts to\\nensure that our evaluations are robust and take into account new trends in\\nabuse. This engagement has helped our teams scale up our ability to evaluate\\n3.5 Sonnet against various types of misuse. For example, we used feedback from\\nchild safety experts at Thorn to update our classifiers and fine-tune our\\nmodels.\\n\\nOne of the core constitutional principles that guides our AI model development\\nis privacy. We do not train our generative models on user-submitted data\\nunless a user gives us explicit permission to do so. To date we have not used\\nany customer or user-submitted data to train our generative models.\\n\\n### Coming soon\\n\\nOur aim is to substantially improve the tradeoff curve between intelligence,\\nspeed, and cost every few months. To complete the Claude 3.5 model family,\\nwe’ll be releasing Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3.5 Opus later this year.\\n\\nIn addition to working on our next-generation model family, we are developing\\nnew modalities and features to support more use cases for businesses,\\nincluding integrations with enterprise applications. Our team is also\\nexploring features like Memory, which will enable Claude to remember a user’s\\npreferences and interaction history as specified, making their experience even\\nmore personalized and efficient.\\n\\nWe’re constantly working to improve Claude and love hearing from our users.\\nYou can submit feedback on Claude 3.5 Sonnet directly in-product to inform our\\ndevelopment roadmap and help our teams to improve your experience. As always,\\nwe look forward to seeing what you build, create, and discover with Claude.\\n\\n  * Claude\\n  * API \\n  * Team\\n  * Pricing\\n  * Research\\n  * Company\\n  * Customers\\n  * News\\n  * Careers\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  * Press Inquiries\\n  * Support\\n  * Status\\n  * Twitter\\n  * LinkedIn\\n  * Availability\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  * Terms of Service – Consumer\\n  * Terms of Service – Commercial\\n  * Privacy Policy\\n  * Usage Policy\\n  * Responsible Disclosure Policy\\n  * Compliance\\n  * Privacy Choices\\n\\n© 2024 Anthropic PBC\\n\\n'"

      "**Overall Feedback:**\n",
      "- The code is well-structured and follows the principles of object-oriented programming.\n",
      "- The comments added to the code significantly improve readability and understanding.\n",
      "- The backtracking algorithm for solving the Sudoku puzzle is correctly implemented.\n",
      "- The use of helper methods (`is_valid`, `find_empty_location`, `print_board`) promotes modularity and code reuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Specific Feedback:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initialization and Attributes:**\n",
      "    - The `__init__` method correctly initializes the board, size, and subgrid size.\n",
      "    - Commenting the parameters and the purpose of the constructor is good practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Validation Method (`is_valid`):**\n",
      "    - The method is well-implemented and checks all necessary conditions (row, column, and subgrid).\n",
      "    - The comments explain each step clearly.\n",
      "    - Potential Improvement: Add a brief comment about why `start_row` and `start_col` are calculated this way (to determine the top-left corner of the subgrid).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Solving Method (`solve`):**\n",
      "    - The recursive backtracking algorithm is implemented correctly.\n",
      "    - The comments explain the base case and the recursive case well.\n",
      "    - Potential Improvement: Consider adding a comment to explain why resetting the cell to 0 is necessary (to backtrack).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Finding Empty Location (`find_empty_location`):**\n",
      "    - The method is straightforward and effectively finds the next empty cell.\n",
      "    - The comments make the purpose and logic clear.\n",
      "    - No immediate improvements are necessary for this method.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Printing the Board (`print_board`):**\n",
      "    - The method prints the board in a readable format.\n",
      "    - The comment explains the method's purpose.\n",
      "    - No immediate improvements are necessary for this method.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Example Usage:**\n",
      "    - The example usage is clear and demonstrates how to use the `SudokuSolver` class.\n",
      "    - It includes a sample board and handles the case where no solution exists.\n",
      "    - Potential Improvement: Consider wrapping the example usage in a `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to prevent it from running if the module is imported elsewhere.\n",

      "Here is the detailed feedback on the provided Sudoku solver code:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Feedback:**\n",
      "- The code is well-structured and follows the principles of object-oriented programming.\n",
      "- The comments added to the code significantly improve readability and understanding.\n",
      "- The backtracking algorithm for solving the Sudoku puzzle is correctly implemented.\n",
      "- The use of helper methods (`is_valid`, `find_empty_location`, `print_board`) promotes modularity and code reuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Specific Feedback:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initialization and Attributes:**\n",
      "    - The `__init__` method correctly initializes the board, size, and subgrid size.\n",
      "    - Commenting the parameters and the purpose of the constructor is good practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Validation Method (`is_valid`):**\n",
      "    - The method is well-implemented and checks all necessary conditions (row, column, and subgrid).\n",
      "    - The comments explain each step clearly.\n",
      "    - Potential Improvement: Add a brief comment about why `start_row` and `start_col` are calculated this way (to determine the top-left corner of the subgrid).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Solving Method (`solve`):**\n",
      "    - The recursive backtracking algorithm is implemented correctly.\n",
      "    - The comments explain the base case and the recursive case well.\n",
      "    - Potential Improvement: Consider adding a comment to explain why resetting the cell to 0 is necessary (to backtrack).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Finding Empty Location (`find_empty_location`):**\n",
      "    - The method is straightforward and effectively finds the next empty cell.\n",
      "    - The comments make the purpose and logic clear.\n",
      "    - No immediate improvements are necessary for this method.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Printing the Board (`print_board`):**\n",
      "    - The method prints the board in a readable format.\n",
      "    - The comment explains the method's purpose.\n",
      "    - No immediate improvements are necessary for this method.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Example Usage:**\n",
      "    - The example usage is clear and demonstrates how to use the `SudokuSolver` class.\n",
      "    - It includes a sample board and handles the case where no solution exists.\n",
      "    - Potential Improvement: Consider wrapping the example usage in a `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to prevent it from running if the module is imported elsewhere.\n",
