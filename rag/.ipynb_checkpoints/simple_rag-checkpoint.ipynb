      "\n",
      "* Gibbs has been performing well so far this season, averaging 18.9 fantasy points per game and scoring four touchdowns in his last five games.\n",
      "* However, he may face some competition for touches next week, as the Packers' run defense has allowed the ninth-most fantasy points per game to the running back position. This could potentially cut into Gibbs' workload.\n",
      "* Additionally, Gibbs' schedule for the rest of the season may not be particularly favorable for fantasy owners. He has some tough matchups coming up against teams with strong defenses, such as the Bills and the Steelers.\n",
      "* On the other hand, Gus Edwards has been on fire lately and is currently the RB1 over the past three weeks. However, he is a touchdown-or-bust player and his production comes mostly from rushing touchdowns.\n",
      "* Finally, Brown is Arizona's clear-cut No. 1 weapon and has seen more targets than any other Cardinal this season. Last year, he averaged 13.7 fantasy points per game and had a 26% TPPR with Murray under center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while Gibbs has been performing well so far, it's important to keep an eye on his workload and schedule moving forward. If you have other options available to you, you may want to consider starting someone else next week, especially if they have a more favorable matchup or schedule.\n"
