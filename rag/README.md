# RAG Notebooks Directory

This directory contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the capabilities and implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain.

## Notebooks

1. **simple_rag.ipynb**
   - **Description**: This notebook serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to RAGs and LangChain. It covers the basic concepts and provides a straightforward example to help users understand how RAG works.
   - **Key Concepts**: Introduction to RAG, LangChain basics, simple implementation.

2. **conversational_rag.ipynb**
   - **Description**: This advanced notebook demonstrates building a conversational RAG using LangChain. The notebook guides the user through the process of creating a RAG that can engage in meaningful conversations, leveraging the power of retrieval-augmented generation.
   - **Key Concepts**: Conversational AI, RAG in-depth, LangChain for conversation, advanced implementation.
